# **Curl** - A simple electric field visualiser

Add charges, move them around, and see the electric field and equipotential surfaces change!

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deeptwonine/curl/refs/heads/main/images/demo.gif)

## Using the program

1. To begin with, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/downloads.shtml) installed.
2. Clone the repository using -
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/deeptwonine/curl.git
   ```
   or simply download the latest **Source code** (zip or tar.gz) file from the [Releases](https://github.com/deeptwonine/curl/releases) and extract it.
4. Run `curl.py` using Python.

## Features

- Add and remove positive and negative charges of any magnitude, and see the electric field and potential gradient they generate, in the form of discrete arrows or electric field lines.
- Move charges around in a well defined play space, and see the electric field and potential gradient change.
- Edit previously added charges.
- View potential and electric field magnitude at every point of working space on mouse hover.
