# Curl
## A simple electric field visualiser

Add charges, move them around, and see the electric field and equipotential surfaces change!

### Using the program
1. To begin with, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/downloads.shtml) installed.
2. Clone the repository using -
   ```git clone https://github.com/deeptwonine/curl.git```
   or simply download the latest source zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/deeptwonine/curl/releases) and unzip it.
3. Run `electric_field.py` using Python.

### Features
- [X] Add and remove positive and negative charges of unit magnitude, and see the electric field they generate.
- [x] Move charges around in a well defined play space, and see the electric field change.
- [X] Rename charges for better identification.
#### To be added 
- [ ] Add charges with custom magnitudes and coordinates (entered as an (x, y) value).
- [ ] Modify magnitude of already added charges.
- [ ] View potential and electric field magnitude at every point of working space on mouse hover.
- [ ] Add charges that are not fixed (can move in electric field generated by other charges).
